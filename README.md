# Natural Language Processing API

This is my fourth project for Front End Nanodegree, Udacity.
For this project, I've built a News Article or Sentiment Analysis webs application using Natural Language Processing API.

The application allows users to type in any URL containing an article or a blog. Then, using Aylien API, the app analyses the sentiment of it through getting insight about the author's polarity and subjectivity, and the confidence in this analysis.
