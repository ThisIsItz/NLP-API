# Natural Language Processing API

This is my fourth project for Front End Nanodegree, Udacity.
For this project, I've build a News Article or Sentiment Analysis webs application using Natural Language Processing API. The application allows user to type in any url containing an article or a blog. Then, using Aylien API, the app analyses the sentiment of it through getting insight about the author's polarity and subjetivity, and the confidence in this analysis.

## How to start

Clone or download the repository, then `cd` into your new folder and run ```npm install```
Then just run ```npm start``` and the application will be ready.

## Skills that I have to use
- Javascript
- Node.js
- Express
- Webpack
- Git

## Test

Installed JEST and created two tests on ./src/js files to check input validation functionality and async function. To test the app just run ```npm test```
